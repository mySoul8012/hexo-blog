# 关于世界

曾经有一刻感受到，这个世界是属于你们的，不是属于我的，曾经有那么一刻感受到，这个世界和我也没有任何的关系。他永远都会按照既定的规则始终运行，和我没有任何的关系。

一个被排除在外的一个人。

未来是属于别人的，也不是属于我的。整个世界和我没有任何关系。

一个空荡荡的人。

内心空荡荡的。

# About the World

There was once a moment when I felt that this world belongs to you, not to me. There was once a moment when I felt that this world has nothing to do with me. It will always operate according to the established rules, and has no connection to me.

A person excluded from everything.

The future belongs to others, not to me. The entire world has nothing to do with me.

An empty person.

An empty heart.

-- Some thoughts about the world.

# 关于爱情

曾经有那么一刻感觉到，这个世界上没有一个人会爱我，也没有一个人会对我无缘无故的好，以及无缘无故的爱。

曾经有那么一刻，产生了一种爱无力的感觉。

曾经有那么一刻，被排除到了整个世界之外。

曾经有那么一刻，感觉不再像个人类。

有那么一刻，有那么一阵的爱无能的感觉。

# About Love

There was once a moment when I felt that no one in this world would ever love me, and no one would ever be kind to me or love me without reason.

There was once a moment when I felt powerless in love.

There was once a moment when I felt excluded from the entire world.

There was once a moment when I no longer felt like a human being.

There was a moment, a brief moment, when I felt utterly incapable of love.
